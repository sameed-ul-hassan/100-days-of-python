100 Days of Python
</h1>
<hr>
Today at <b>November 22, 2023 </b> I'm pledging to take the 
100 days of code challenge. In next 100 days I'll be learning and
practicing python (Hopefully not missing a single dayðŸ˜œ). I'll be
following Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code">100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.</a>
<br><br>
I'll use this repo to update my progress on daily basis, will upload 
completion certificate on last day as well.
